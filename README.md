# Tenbury Wells RFC - Milestone 1 Project

![Site Preview](assets/images/TenburyRFC-preview.png)
---

This project is for my local rugby team based in Tenbury Wells, they currently use a generic Pitchero site like many other clubs around them. The goal of this project is to make the club standout with their own site, aswell as providing clear information for users, such as upcoming fixtures and results, club news, squad detials and include contact detials for any interested players, fans or sponsors.

## UX

### User Goals

I expect that the majority of the users will fall into the following criteria:

- Be a player or coach from either Tenbury Wells RFC or a rival club
- Be a supporter of the team
- A local player looking to join the team

### User Stories

- As a user I want to view the latest club news, so that I can keep myself updated with the latest club news.
- As a user I want to see the league table and results, so that I can see how the team is performing.
- As a user I want to see the season fixtures, so that I can plan on attending the games.
- As a user I want to be able to contact coaches, so that I can inquire about joining the team.
- As a user I want the wesbite to both be visually appealing and easy to navigate, so I can easily find information and navigate to different pages.
- As a user I want to be able to view the current squad, so that I can see what positions the team might need and see who is in the current squad.

### Wireframes

[Here](https://github.com/filleben/TenburyWellsRFC/tree/master/assets/wireframes/initial-designs) are initial designs I made for the site.

When I was making the site I made a few design changes which I believe improved both the visuals and ease of use. The major changes are:

- Removed the title text and centered the navabar on all pages.
- Moved the results and fixtures to below the league table on the results page.
- Added a image carousel to the squad page.
- Added a 4th page with contact information, map and contact form.

The final designs of the site can be found [here](https://github.com/filleben/TenburyWellsRFC/tree/master/assets/wireframes/final-designs)

The wireframes were made using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud)

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features

- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
  - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
