# Tenbury Wells RFC - Milestone 1 Project

This project is for my local rugby team based in Tenbury Wells, they currently use a generic Pitchero site like many other clubs around them. The goal of this project is to make the club standout with their own site, aswell as providing clear information for users, such as upcoming fixtures and results, club news, squad detials and include contact detials for any interested players, fans or sponsors.
